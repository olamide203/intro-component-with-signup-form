## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS
-   BEM CSS Naming convention
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to implement form validation using regular expressions in JavaScript

### Continued development

The email regex used in this project doesn't return a match for some valid emails. I plan to come up with a better regex pattern using the [RFC 3696](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3696) specifications

### Useful resources

-   [Regexr](https://regexr.com/) - This helped me test regex patterns before using them
-   [Regular expressions](https://javascript.info/regular-expressions) - This helped me learn about some advanced regular expression patterns
